## Tasks

Complete the following mini-tasks using whatever resources you'd like:

1. Use php or javascript to connect to and pull down content (e.g., tweets, pins, posts, statuses) from any one of the following social networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, or Facebook.

2. Use php or javascript to output the language names (e.g., German, English) from this url (http://gmc.lingotek.com/language).

3. List the HTTP requests (i.e., HTTP method, URL) and responses (i.e., HTTP status code) used for both #1 and #2 above.

You should use php for one of the tasks and javascript for the other (you can choose which, either way is fine).  Again, we encourage you to use the internet as much as you want --- we just ask that you share whatever sources you use.  We are interested in how you go about this process and that you can demonstrate your understanding of what is happening technically.

## Solution

For task 1, I will use NodeJS to pull down tweets from Twitter. I will log the HTTP requests as I go.

For task 2, I will install WAMP and use PHP to grab the language data, JSON decode it, and output the language names. I will also log the HTTP requests as I go.
